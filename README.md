# some-animations
This is just a set of JavaScript files (and the associated CSS) for animations that I need.
The sctructure is fairly easy and it's composed two directories [css](css/) and [js](js/).
The js directory holds files that have descriptive names , and the css directory holds files that have the same name as the javascript file for the same animation.

1.[Cards on scroll](js/cards_on_scroll.js)

Responsible [css file](css/cards_on_scroll)
